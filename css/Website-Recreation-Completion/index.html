        <h3>Jigglypuff</h3>
        <p>Jigglypuff has very stretchy skin and will inflate itself if it gets angry. In the anime, it has been shown to draw on people's faces after they have fallen asleep. However, most Jigglypuff are not accustomed to Pokémon with abilities like Insomnia, which prevent drowsiness. They will sing endlessly to try to put such Pokémon to sleep, putting themselves in danger of asphyxiation. Luckily, this behavior is generally a one-time mistake, and a Jigglypuff will quickly learn its lesson. Recently, it was discovered that different populations of Jigglypuff utilize different methods of singing, ranging from lilting melodies to near-shouts.</p>

        <h3>Diancie</h3>
        <p>It is believed to rule over an entire underground kingdom of jewels called the Diamond Domain, served by loyal Carbink. Diancie oversees the legendary Diamond Domain and makes sure that it always remains hidden from those who intended to loot it or steal from it. It also is in charge of creating the Heart Diamond, a mystical gemstone that, according to legend, is the sole source of energy that allows the Diamond Domain to continue to exist.</p>
